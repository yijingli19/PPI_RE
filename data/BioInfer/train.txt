False
alpha-catenin	cadherin	Since  <*> alpha-catenin </*>  is required for  <#> cadherin </#> -mediated adhesion, the armadillo repeat region alone probably cannot promote cell adhesion, making it unlikely that beta-catenin induces axis duplication by increasing cell adhesion.	False

Ras	cyclin E-dependent kinase	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of  <*> Ras </*>  with Myc allows the generation of  <#> cyclin E-dependent kinase </#>  activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).	True
UL5	UL52	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins,  <*> UL5 </*> , UL8, UL9, UL42,  <#> UL52 </#> , SSB, and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.	False
p21	Cip1	PF4-dependent downregulation of cyclin E-cdk2 activity was associated with increased binding of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor,  <*> p21 </*> ( <#> Cip1 </#> /WAF1), to the cyclin E-cdk2 complex.	False

smooth muscle myosin heavy chain	S-100	The neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, Factor-XIIIa, alpha-smooth muscle actin and CD34, but negative for desmin, calponin, high molecular weight caldesmon,  <*> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </*> , collagen type IV, laminin and  <#> S-100 </#>  protein.	False
H3	histone	Because histone  <*> H3 </*>  shares many structural features with  <#> histone </#>  H4 and is intimately associated with H4 in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether H3 has similar functions.	False
myosin	myosin	The sites on the myosin heavy chain that interact with actin and are responsible for force generation are ill-defined: crosslinking and experiments with isolated domains of the  <*> myosin </*>  head implicate regions in both the 50K and 20K (molecular weights in thousands) domains of the  <#> myosin </#>  head (subfragment 1, S1) in this process.

actin	myosin heavy chain	We find that heterozygotes for  <*> actin </*>  (Act88F) or  <#> myosin heavy chain </#>  (Mhc36B) null alleles have complex myofibrillar defects, whereas Mhc36B-/+; Act88F-/+ double heterozygotes have nearly normal myofibrils.	False
plakoglobin	plakoglobin	beta-catenin or  <*> plakoglobin </*>  is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/ <#> plakoglobin </#>  and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.	False

E-cad	beta-catenin	We found that the down-regulation of  <*> E-cad </*> , alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for  <#> beta-catenin </#> , the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

CBP	p300	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that  <*> CBP </*> / <#> p300 </#> , and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.	False
MSH3	msh3	In this study the role of MSH2,  <*> MSH3 </*> , and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2,  <#> msh3 </#> , and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins.	False
DBR1	BUD8	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1,  <*> DBR1 </*> , CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10,  <#> BUD8 </#>  and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.	False
RAD 54	57	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and RAD52 proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the rad52-20 allele, but  <*> RAD 54 </*> , 55 and  <#> 57 </#>  did not suppress.	False

False

True

False
actin	actin	Although profilin released  <*> actin </*>  at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized  <#> actin </#>  associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.	False
actin	talin	These results show that the C-terminal  <*> actin </*> -binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the  <#> talin </#>  molecule.	True

True
villin	fimbrin	In brush cells,  <*> villin </*>  and  <#> fimbrin </#>  are not only present in the actin filament core bundles of apical microvilli and their long rootlets but, in addition, both proteins are also associated with microvilli extending from the basolateral cell surface of the brush cells.

False
PKC	profilin	These results suggest that activation of  <*> PKC </*>  precedes the activation of PI and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and  <#> profilin </#> .	False
TRADD	FADD	Notably, the two pro-apoptotic adapter proteins  <*> TRADD </*>  and  <#> FADD </#>  are also involved in the activation of A-SMase.	False

PCAF	p53	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative  <*> PCAF </*>  substrates, histones H3 and H4 and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that histone H3 is significantly preferred over the histone H4 and  <#> p53 </#>  substrates.	False
actin	calmodulin	We report here that tropomyosin, which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the villin and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect  <*> actin </*>  binding by 110-kD  <#> calmodulin </#> .	True

True
profilin	profilin	The higher affinity of vaccinia profilin for polyphosphoinositides (Kd = 0.2-8.5 microM) than for actin or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia  <*> profilin </*>  expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia  <#> profilin </#>  binds preferentially to PIP and PIP2 in vivo.

Ras	cyclin E-dependent kinase	However, although expression of  <*> Ras </*>  alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of  <#> cyclin E-dependent kinase </#>  activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).	False
p19	p18	The Arp2/3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins, p40, p35,  <*> p19 </*> ,  <#> p18 </#> , and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).

fimbrin	actin	The Tetrahymena  <*> fimbrin </*>  has two  <#> actin </#> -binding domains, but lacks the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding motif, suggesting that Tetrahymena fimbrin probably cross-links actin filaments in a Ca(2+)- insensitive manner during cytokinesis.	True
PCNA	2B	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( <*> PCNA </*> ), histone H1, histone H2A +  <#> 2B </#> , histone H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.

PCAF	histone	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative  <*> PCAF </*>  substrates, histones H3 and H4 and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that histone H3 is significantly preferred over the  <#> histone </#>  H4 and p53 substrates.	False
EGFR	tyrosine kinase	Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with  <*> EGFR </*>  were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR  <#> tyrosine kinase </#> , whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not.	False

actin	profilin	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of  <*> actin </*>  in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and  <#> profilin </#> .	False
actin	talin	Lack of detection in these preparations of a constituent that binds RBC alpha-spectrin antibody plus the presence of significant quantities of  <*> actin </*> , further suggests that the principal membrane skeletal element is actin with perhaps smaller quantities of a 240-kd component, identified by others as the protein  <#> talin </#> .	False
UL5	helicase-primase	The ability of these three mutant  <*> UL5 </*>  proteins to form specific interactions with other members of the  <#> helicase-primase </#>  complex, UL8 and UL52, indicates that the functional domains required for replication activity of UL5 are separable from domains responsible for protein-protein interactions.

cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	CIP1	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the  <*> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </*>  p21(WAF1/ <#> CIP1 </#> ) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol) delta in the conversion reaction.	True

profilin	actin	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of  <*> profilin </*>  in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized  <#> actin </#>  content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.	True

False
cofilin	actin	The results clearly showed that the mutated  <*> cofilin </*>  possessing KTLKK instead of KKRKK did not translocate into the nuclei in response to heat shock whereas a recombinant cofilin with the unaltered sequence of KKRKK responded to heat shock and formed intranuclear rods together with  <#> actin </#> .

actin	actin	To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated  <*> actin </*>  polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the  <#> actin </#>  dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.	False
UL5	Rep68	We show that the HSV-1  <*> UL5 </*> , UL8, UL29, UL30, UL42, and UL52 gene products along with the AAV  <#> Rep68 </#>  protein are sufficient to initiate replication on duplex DNA containing the AAV origins of replication, resulting in products several hundred nucleotides in length.

profilin	profilin	The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human  <*> profilin </*>  yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast  <#> profilin </#>  and pyrene-labeled yeast actin.	False
CIP1	Pol	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/ <*> CIP1 </*> ) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase ( <#> Pol </#> ) delta in the conversion reaction.

MSH2	MSH6	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of  <*> MSH2 </*> -dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and  <#> MSH6 </#> , and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.	True
H4	histone	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone  <*> H4 </*>  versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was  <#> histone </#>  H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).	False
UL52	UL29	Cotransfections with different combinations of these genes demonstrated that a subset of four of them, coding for the HSV helicase-primase complex (UL5, UL8,  <*> UL52 </*> ) and the major DNA-binding protein ( <#> UL29 </#> ), was already sufficient to mediate the helper effect.	False

True
fibronectin	beta1 integrin	The undifferentiated cells (a) were unable to spread on gelatin or laminin and grew as rounded colonies, although they were able to spread on fibronectin (b) showed reduced adhesion to laminin, but not  <*> fibronectin </*>  (c) expressed much reduced levels of  <#> beta1 integrin </#> , although levels of alpha5 and alphaV were wild-type (d) were less polarized with increased membrane protrusions compared with a vinculin (-/-) ES cell mutant (e) were unable to assemble vinculin or paxillin-containing focal adhesions or actin stress fibers on fibronectin, whereas vinculin (-/-) ES cells were able to assemble talin-containing focal adhesions.

H3	waf1	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone  <*> H3 </*> , was acetylated from the endogenous p21/ <#> waf1 </#>  promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.	True
myogenin	MyoD1	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous  <*> myogenin </*>  and myosin light chain 2 gene but not the endogenous  <#> MyoD1 </#> , MRF4, Myf5, the skeletal muscle actin, or the myosin heavy chain genes.	False

alpha-catenin	beta-catenin	 <*> alpha-catenin </*>  inhibits  <#> beta-catenin </#>  signaling by preventing formation of a beta-catenin*T-cell factor*DNA complex.	True
Tax	Tax	Glutathione S-transferase pull-down performed with  <*> Tax </*>  deletion mutants and peptide competition have localized the site in Tax critical for binding CBP/p300 to a highly protease-sensitive region around amino acid residues 81 to 95 (81QRTSKTLKVLTPPIT95) which lies between the domains previously proposed to be important for CREB binding and  <#> Tax </#>  subunit dimerization.

False
E-cadherin	gamma-catenin	However, when all of the four proteins ( <*> E-cadherin </*> , alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and  <#> gamma-catenin </#> ) were analysed as one group, a significant association was seen between reduction in immunoreactivity of at least one of these four proteins and the presence of metastases.	False
UL5	UL52	Cotransfections with different combinations of these genes demonstrated that a subset of four of them, coding for the HSV helicase-primase complex ( <*> UL5 </*> , UL8,  <#> UL52 </#> ) and the major DNA-binding protein (UL29), was already sufficient to mediate the helper effect.	True
p27	CKI	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the  <*> p27 </*>  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( <#> CKI </#> ).	True
actin	actin	Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester  <*> actin </*>  monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for  <#> actin </#>  may be under metabolic control.	False
BRCA1	BRCA2	We investigate allelic losses in microsatellites of the RAD51, RAD52, RAD54,  <*> BRCA1 </*>  and  <#> BRCA2 </#>  regions, and their correlations with nine pathologic parameters in 127 breast carcinomas.	False

M1	mitogen-activated protein kinase	The findings suggest that  <*> M1 </*>  muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via  <#> mitogen-activated protein kinase </#>  (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

gamma-catenin	plakoglobin	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with beta-catenin, whereas the binding of  <*> gamma-catenin </*>  ( <#> plakoglobin </#> ) to E-cadherin is less efficient.	False
MSH3	PMS1	We used yeast as a model to test this hypothesis and found that chromosome deletion of any known nuclear mitotic mismatch repair genes, including MLH1, MSH2,  <*> MSH3 </*> , MSH6, and  <#> PMS1 </#> , did not rescue mgt1delta O6 MeG DNA repair methyltransferase-deficient cells from killing by MNNG.	False
profilin	gelsolin	This effect is specific to  <*> profilin </*>  and  <#> gelsolin </#>  because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.	False

actin	profilin	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized  <*> actin </*>  content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from  <#> profilin </#>  too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.	False
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	p27	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the  <*> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </*>  p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in  <#> p27 </#> (KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.

True
fimbrin	Mdm20p	In contrast, act1-159 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in  <*> fimbrin </*> ,  <#> Mdm20p </#> , and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these actin-binding proteins.

IgG	vinculin	Although binding patterns of different sera were not identical, almost all sera caused  <*> IgG </*>  binding to platelet components of 87-90 kD, 140 kD (identified as  <#> vinculin </#> ) and 220-240 kD (tentatively identified as talin and actin-binding protein).	True

False
cofilin	capping protein	Interactions of ADF/ <*> cofilin </*> , Arp2/3 complex,  <#> capping protein </#>  and profilin in remodeling of branched actin filament networks.	True
acetylase	H4	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified  <*> acetylase </*> , histone  <#> H4 </#>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).	True
AH	histone	Western analysis of gel-purified USF-nucleosome and GAL4- <*> AH </*> -nucleosome complexes demonstrated the predominant presence of acetylated histone H4 relative to acetylated  <#> histone </#>  H3.	False
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	CKI	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27  <*> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </*>  ( <#> CKI </#> ).	False
N	L	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'- <*> N </*> -4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and  <#> L </#>  is the proposed transcriptase gene.

True
actin	PI 3-kinase	This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or  <*> actin </*>  do not affect  <#> PI 3-kinase </#>  activity.	True

cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	cyclin D1	The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on bombesin-stimulated cell cycle progression did not involve accumulation of the  <*> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </*>  p27(kip1) but a striking inhibition of the expression of  <#> cyclin D1 </#> .	False
beta-catenin	E-cadherin	Biopsies taken prior to NAC and operative specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for alpha-catenin,  <*> beta-catenin </*> ,  <#> E-cadherin </#> , and CD44 isoform 6 (CD44v6), to uncover the role of adhesion molecules as determinants of the response to NAC and disease outcome.

Fas	MORT1	In their cytoplasmic region, some of these receptors share a conserved sequence motif - the 'death domain' - which is required for transduction of the apoptotic signal by recruiting other death-domain-containing adaptor molecules like the  <*> Fas </*> -associated protein FADD/ <#> MORT1 </#>  or the TNF receptor-associated protein TRADD [2-4].	True
alpha-catenin	c-erbB2	We found that the down-regulation of E-cad,  <*> alpha-catenin </*> , and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with  <#> c-erbB2 </#>  down-regulation.	False

actin	cofilin	In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear  <*> actin </*>  rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while  <#> cofilin </#>  was present in multinucleated myotubes.	False
actin	profilin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of  <*> actin </*>  filaments;  <#> profilin </#>  inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.	False
CDK2	cyclin D3	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/ <*> CDK2 </*>  complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to  <#> cyclin D3 </#> /CDK4).	False
beta-catenin	gamma-catenin	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with  <*> beta-catenin </*> , whereas the binding of  <#> gamma-catenin </#>  (plakoglobin) to E-cadherin is less efficient.	False

False
actin	profilin	The interaction between calf spleen profilin and  <*> actin </*>  depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of  <#> profilin </#> , the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.	False
actin	vinculin	Most of these integrins, with their intracellular domains, interact with the  <*> actin </*> -containing cytoskeleton, via linking proteins such as  <#> vinculin </#>  and talin, while one of them interacts with the keratin filaments, via an as yet unknown linking molecule(s).	True

alpha-catenin	beta-catenin	beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or  <*> alpha-catenin </*> , becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of  <#> beta-catenin </#> .	False
KIP1	KIP1	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27( <*> KIP1 </*> ) that is accompanied by an increase in p27( <#> KIP1 </#> ) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.	True
CHK1	MAD3	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53,  <*> CHK1 </*> , PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and  <#> MAD3 </#>  had little effect.	False

RAD51	RAD52	In contrast, the  <*> RAD51 </*>  and  <#> RAD52 </#>  genes are essential for homothallic mating-type switching.	False
actin	actin	Because beta-catenin is known to interact with alpha-catenin, which binds to  <*> actin </*> , we generated a fusion molecule consisting of the ectodomain of E-cadherin and the  <#> actin </#>  binding site of alpha-catenin.	False
histones	H4	The core histones from Physarum,  <*> histones </*>  H2A, H2B, H3, and  <#> H4 </#> , are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.	True
actin	myosin II	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all myosin heavy chains, and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated  <*> actin </*> -dependent MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium  <#> myosin II </#>  requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.	True
high molecular weight caldesmon	S-100	The neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, Factor-XIIIa, alpha-smooth muscle actin and CD34, but negative for desmin, calponin,  <*> high molecular weight caldesmon </*> , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, collagen type IV, laminin and  <#> S-100 </#>  protein.	False
Ras	CKI	However, although expression of  <*> Ras </*>  alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( <#> CKI </#> ).	False
VEGF	tyrosine kinase	Neuropilin 1 (NP-1) is a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor ( <*> VEGF </*> ) 165 (VEGF165) and acts as a coreceptor that enhances VEGF165 function through  <#> tyrosine kinase </#>  VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2).	False
profilin	actin	The very much lower affinity of  <*> profilin </*>  for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled  <#> actin </#> .	False

False
beta-catenin	proteasome	 <*> beta-catenin </*> , but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when  <#> proteasome </#> -mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.	False

False
p38	IL-2	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via  <*> p38 </*>  MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <#> IL-2 </#>  production.

False
actin	actin	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled  <*> actin </*>  in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled  <#> actin </#> .

False
p21	waf1	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous  <*> p21 </*> / <#> waf1 </#>  promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

False
actin	profilin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <*> actin </*>  with  <#> profilin </#>  cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.	True

False
alpha-catenin	plakoglobin	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with  <*> alpha-catenin </*>  but interacts with high affinity with beta-catenin, whereas the binding of gamma-catenin ( <#> plakoglobin </#> ) to E-cadherin is less efficient.	False
actin	NM-type cofilin	The deduced peptide sequence contained a nuclear localization signal and a putative  <*> actin </*> -binding sequence as reported in  <#> NM-type cofilin </#> .	True
beta-catenin	actin	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to  <*> beta-catenin </*> /plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the  <#> actin </#>  cytoskeleton.	False

False
RAD51	57	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and RAD52 proteins interact,  <*> RAD51 </*>  on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the rad52-20 allele, but RAD 54, 55 and  <#> 57 </#>  did not suppress.	True
helicase-primase	UL29	Cotransfections with different combinations of these genes demonstrated that a subset of four of them, coding for the HSV  <*> helicase-primase </*>  complex (UL5, UL8, UL52) and the major DNA-binding protein ( <#> UL29 </#> ), was already sufficient to mediate the helper effect.	False

False
spleen profilin	profilin	The interaction between calf  <*> spleen profilin </*>  and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of  <#> profilin </#> , the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.	False
platelet actin	actin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of  <*> platelet actin </*>  much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <#> actin </#>  with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

MSH2	MSH3	In addition to their role in mismatch repair (MMR), the  <*> MSH2 </*>  and  <#> MSH3 </#>  gene products are required to remove 3' nonhomologous DNA tails during genetic recombination.	False
profilin	actin	Dispersal of  <*> profilin </*>  from such sites by oligoproline-rich peptide inhibitors suggests that profilin is directly involved in intracellular pathogen locomotion and reorganization of  <#> actin </#>  cytoskeleton of the host cell peripheral membrane.	False

True
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	Pol	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the  <*> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </*>  p21(WAF1/CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase ( <#> Pol </#> ) delta in the conversion reaction.	False
alpha-catenin	beta-catenin	We found that the down-regulation of E-cad,  <*> alpha-catenin </*> , and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for  <#> beta-catenin </#> , the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

False
A23R	VITF-3	Expression of the A8R and  <*> A23R </*>  genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for  <#> VITF-3 </#>  in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo.	False
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	p27	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the  <*> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </*>  p27, enhanced association of  <#> p27 </#>  with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).	False
INK4a	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16( <*> INK4a </*> )  <#> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </#> .	True

False
actin	profilin	Since our earlier studies of Acanthamoeba profilins suggested the importance of PIP2 binding for suppression, we conclude that both activities are implicated and that an interplay between PIP2 binding and  <*> actin </*>  binding may be important for  <#> profilin </#>  function.	True
cyclin D1	cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor	The hyperproliferative response observed in the gastric mucosa is secondary to this initial insult and is associated with increased expression of  <*> cyclin D1 </*> , the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a and of p53 and decreased expression of the  <#> cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor </#>  p27kip1.

BCK1-20	MKK1	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <*> BCK1-20 </*>  mutation nor increased dosage of  <#> MKK1 </#>  (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.	False
G proteins	RAFT1	Newly disclosed interactions between gephyrin, exchange factors for  <*> G proteins </*>  of the Rho and Rac families, the translational regulator  <#> RAFT1 </#> , and actin-binding proteins like profilin might integrate activity-dependent and trophic-factor-mediated signals at developing postsynaptic sites.

profilins	profilin-I	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native  <*> profilins </*> ; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native  <#> profilin-I </#> ; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

actin	actin	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <*> actin </*>  released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized  <#> actin </#>  associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.	True
talin	cortexillin I	This technique was employed to quantify changes caused by the lack of  <*> talin </*> , a protein that couples the actin network to the plasma membrane, or by the lack of  <#> cortexillin I </#>  or II, two isoforms of the actin-bundling protein cortexillin.	False

myosins IB	calmodulin	The genes considered are those for 5S, 5.8S and 18S rRNA, actin I, profilins Ia/b and II,  <*> myosins IB </*> , IC and II, and  <#> calmodulin </#> .	False
fimbrin	CAP1	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1),  <*> fimbrin </*>  (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein ( <#> CAP1 </#>  and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.	False
APC	alpha-catenin	The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with  <*> APC </*> , although the amino-terminal half independently binds  <#> alpha-catenin </#> .	False
type XIII collagen	vinculin	Here we demonstrate that  <*> type XIII collagen </*>  is concentrated in cultured skin fibroblasts and several other human mesenchymal cell lines in the focal adhesions at the ends of actin stress fibers, co-localizing with the known focal adhesion components talin and  <#> vinculin </#> .	True
TRADD	TRAIL receptors 1	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins FADD/MORT1,  <*> TRADD </*> , and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating caspases-8 and -10 in death signaling by the two death-inducing  <#> TRAIL receptors 1 </#>  and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) are controversial.	True

False
histone	histone	Archaeal histones are most similar to the globular  <*> histone </*>  fold region of eukaryal  <#> histone </#>  H4, and the results reported are consistent with archaeal nucleosomes resembling the structure formed by eukaryal histone (H3+H4)2tetramers.	False
RIP	FADD	Thus, both DR5 and DR4 use FADD, TRADD, and  <*> RIP </*>  in their signal transduction pathways, and  <#> FADD </#>  is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.	False
ERCC2	HHR23A	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include ERCC1,  <*> ERCC2 </*>  (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the HHR23B/p58 and  <#> HHR23A </#>  subunits of XPC.	False
actin	profilin	act1-157, an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in  <*> actin </*>  organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a  <#> profilin </#>  mutant defective in actin binding.	False

True
DFG9	DFG10	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5,  <*> DFG9 </*> ,  <#> DFG10 </#> , BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.	False
PNR	histone	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase ( <*> PNR </*> ), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),  <#> histone </#>  H1, histone H2A + 2B, histone H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.	False
H4	H3	Because histone H3 shares many structural features with histone  <*> H4 </*>  and is intimately associated with H4 in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether  <#> H3 </#>  has similar functions.	False
H3	p53	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates, histones  <*> H3 </*>  and H4 and the transcription factor  <#> p53 </#> , and have determined that histone H3 is significantly preferred over the histone H4 and p53 substrates.	False

beta-catenin	CBP	Armadillo (Arm) repeat 10 to the COOH terminus of  <*> beta-catenin </*>  is involved in binding to CBP, whereas beta-catenin interacts directly with the CREB-binding domain of  <#> CBP </#> .	False
WAF1	delta	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21( <*> WAF1 </*> /CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol)  <#> delta </#>  in the conversion reaction.	False
profilin	actin	The very much lower affinity of  <*> profilin </*>  for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled  <#> actin </#>  in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.	False

False
profilin	profilin	Although  <*> profilin </*>  released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from  <#> profilin </#>  too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.	False
CBP	E2A	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that  <*> CBP </*> /p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with  <#> E2A </#>  in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.	True
beta-catenin	p120	Hypertonicity provoked Fyn-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in  <*> beta-catenin </*> , alpha-catenin, and  <#> p120 </#> (Cas) and caused the dissociation of beta-catenin from the contacts.	False

MEC1	MEC3	In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest requires the checkpoint control genes RAD9, RAD17, RAD24,  <*> MEC1 </*> , MEC2 and  <#> MEC3 </#> .	False
tropomyosin	actin	We report here that  <*> tropomyosin </*> , which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the villin and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect  <#> actin </#>  binding by 110-kD calmodulin.	True
UL42	UL52	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins, UL5, UL8, UL9,  <*> UL42 </*> ,  <#> UL52 </#> , SSB, and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.

H3	SP2	We have shown that these proteins are indeed nuclear basic proteins: the 14 kd is the histone H4, the 19 kd is the histone  <*> H3 </*> , and the 25 kd is the sperm-specific protein  <#> SP2 </#> .	False
p300	Tax	Glutathione S-transferase pull-down performed with Tax deletion mutants and peptide competition have localized the site in Tax critical for binding CBP/ <*> p300 </*>  to a highly protease-sensitive region around amino acid residues 81 to 95 (81QRTSKTLKVLTPPIT95) which lies between the domains previously proposed to be important for CREB binding and  <#> Tax </#>  subunit dimerization.

histones	H2A	The core histones from Physarum,  <*> histones </*>  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones  <#> H2A </#>  and H2B show less heterogeneity.

TNFR1	FLICE	Transcriptional expression of  <*> TNFR1 </*> (p55), as well as that of  <#> FLICE </#> , Fas, FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.	False

helicase-primase	UL52	Cotransfections with different combinations of these genes demonstrated that a subset of four of them, coding for the HSV  <*> helicase-primase </*>  complex (UL5, UL8,  <#> UL52 </#> ) and the major DNA-binding protein (UL29), was already sufficient to mediate the helper effect.	True
E-cadherin	alpha-catenin	In the basal layer, patches of brightly labeled cells were detected with antibodies to  <*> E-cadherin </*> , beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, but not with antibodies to P-cadherin,  <#> alpha-catenin </#> , or with pan-desmocollin and pan-desmoglein antibodies.	False

False
WASp	WASp	 <*> WASp </*>  contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC42Hs as well as verprolin/cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by CDC42Hs- <#> WASp </#>  has been identified.	False
fimbrin	actin	Using the known three-dimensional structure of the homologous actin-binding domain of  <*> fimbrin </*> , these results have enabled us to determine the likely orientation of the utrophin  <#> actin </#> -binding domain with respect to the actin filament.	False
Fas	TRADD	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE,  <*> Fas </*> , FADD, DR3, FAF,  <#> TRADD </#> , and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False
MKK1	MAP kinase	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of  <*> MKK1 </*>  (MEK) or MPK1 ( <#> MAP kinase </#> ) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.	False
SF	E-cadherin	HGF/ <*> SF </*>  treatment of LoVo reduced the amount of alpha-catenin complexed with  <#> E-cadherin </#>  more markedly than in L-10, but in both cell lines this reduction was not accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, suggesting the presence of a mechanism other than phosphorylation for release from cell-cell adhesion during cell motility.	False
TD77	TD77	To investigate the possibility that  <*> TD77 </*>  disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for  <#> TD77 </#>  and actin binding.	False
N	V	Complete gene sequences for the nucleocapsid protein ( <*> N </*> ) and phosphoprotein (P/ <#> V </#> ) have been determined and recombinant N and V proteins produced in baculovirus.	False

E-cadherin	catenin	Immunoprecipitation with an  <*> E-cadherin </*>  mAb, which is known to co-precipitate the catenins, demonstrated that the three poorly differentiated cell lines expressing E-cadherin did not co-precipitate alpha-catenin, although all of the moderately-well differentiated cell lines expressed both alpha- and beta- <#> catenin </#> .	False
muscarinic receptors	c-Jun N-terminal kinase	The findings suggest that M1  <*> muscarinic receptors </*>  are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and  <#> c-Jun N-terminal kinase </#> , but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.	False
alpha-catenin	alpha-catenin	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of  <*> alpha-catenin </*> , although  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.	False
E-cadherin	polymerase	To clarify the relation between alteration of expression of cell adhesion molecules and progression of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas 55 cases were immunohistochemically examined for  <*> E-cadherin </*> , alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and CD44, with additional reverse transcription- <#> polymerase </#>  chain reaction and Southern blotting hybridization (RT-PCR/SBH) assays.	False
CDC55	DFG16	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1,  <*> CDC55 </*> , SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and  <#> DFG16 </#> , mutations that block filamentous growth.	False

False
TNF-RI	MORT-1	Isolation and characterization of death domain ( <*> TNF-RI </*> , Fas, TRADD, FADD/ <#> MORT-1 </#> , RIP) and TRAF domain-containing proteins (TRAF-1, TRAF-2, TRAF-3) have partially bridged a large molecular gap within one of several signaling pathways which originate at the plasma membrane and terminate in the nucleus.	False
GIC2	Cdc42p	From previous work, the BNI1, GIC1, and  <*> GIC2 </*>  gene products also appear to be involved in linking  <#> Cdc42p </#>  to the actin cytoskeleton.	True
SF	alpha-catenin	HGF/ <*> SF </*>  treatment of LoVo reduced the amount of  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  complexed with E-cadherin more markedly than in L-10, but in both cell lines this reduction was not accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, suggesting the presence of a mechanism other than phosphorylation for release from cell-cell adhesion during cell motility.	False
cofilin	actin	The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of  <*> cofilin </*>  to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric  <#> actin </#>  to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.	False
L	4b	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G- <*> L </*> -5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and  <#> 4b </#>  are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.	False
actin	profilin	Fluorographic analysis showed that the specific activity of soluble actin was two to three times that of its particulate form and that soluble  <*> actin </*> , cofilin, actin depolymerizing factor, and  <#> profilin </#>  were transported at similar rates in slow component b of axonal flow.	False
profilin	actin	How  <*> profilin </*> /barbed-end synergy controls  <#> actin </#>  polymerization: a kinetic model of the ATP hydrolysis circuit.	True
RIP	FAP	To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for Fas, Fas ligand, TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD,  <*> RIP </*> , FAF,  <#> FAP </#> , and caspase-8.	False
H3	E2A	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone  <*> H3 </*> , was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with  <#> E2A </#>  in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.	False
actin	actin	The  <*> actin </*>  monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of actin filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on  <#> actin </#> , and promoting barbed-end assembly.	False
MEK	glc7-10	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 ( <*> MEK </*> ) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed  <#> glc7-10 </#>  effectively.

False
beta-catenin	EGFR	Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of  <*> beta-catenin </*>  with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the  <#> EGFR </#>  tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not.	False
beta-catenin	alpha-catenin	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of  <*> beta-catenin </*>  linked to the amino terminus of alpha-catenin 57-264 behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since beta-catenin binding disrupts the  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  dimer.	False
KIP1	cyclin E	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27( <*> KIP1 </*> ) specifically bound to  <#> cyclin E </#>  and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.	True
MSH6	MSH2	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and  <*> MSH6 </*>  or  <#> MSH2 </#>  and MSH3.	False
H3	H3	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B,  <*> H3 </*> , and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone  <#> H3 </#>  has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.	False

False
actin	vinculin	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal  <*> actin </*>  filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another actin and  <#> vinculin </#> -binding protein from focal adhesions.

cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors	CKIs	To determine the relationship between cell cycle regulation and differentiation, the spatiotemporal expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, the  <*> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors </*>  ( <#> CKIs </#> ) p27 and p57, and markers of differentiating podocytes in developing human kidneys was investigated by immunohistochemistry.	False
N-cadherin	beta-catenin	Stable transfection of mutant plakoglobin molecules showed that deletion of the  <*> N-cadherin </*>  binding domain, but not the alpha-catenin binding domain, abolished  <#> beta-catenin </#>  downregulation.	False
actin	platelet actin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of  <*> actin </*>  filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of  <#> platelet actin </#>  much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.	False
profilin	actin	Recent evidence that  <*> profilin </*>  inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of  <#> actin </#>  has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.	True
actin	capping protein	In Acanthamoeba  <*> actin </*>  polymerization is regulated, at least in part, by profilin, which binds to actin monomers, and by  <#> capping protein </#> , which both nucleates polymerization and blocks monomer addition at the 'barbed' end of the filament.	True
profilin	actin	Study of mutated yeast profilins and profilins from Acanthamoeba suggests that the ability of  <*> profilin </*>  to suppress cap- cells is dependent upon a property other than, or in addition to, its ability to bind  <#> actin </#> .	True
UL42	Pol	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins, UL5, UL8, UL9,  <*> UL42 </*> , UL52, SSB, and  <#> Pol </#> , that are essential for viral DNA replication.	False
TESK2	cofilin	Like TESK1,  <*> TESK2 </*>  phosphorylated  <#> cofilin </#>  specifically at Ser-3 and induced formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions.	True

MEK	glc7-10	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 ( <*> MEK </*> ) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a  <#> glc7-10 </#>  dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.	False
actin	WASP	Recently, two mammalian proteins previously shown to regulate the  <*> actin </*>  cytoskeleton, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( <#> WASP </#> ) and its homolog expressed in neurons (N-WASP), were found to possess short peptide motifs homologous to one part of verprolin.	True

False
actin	skeletal muscle actin	Inhibition of  <*> actin </*>  polymerization in KCl was stronger than that of the parental profilin, and the Kd value of its interaction with rabbit  <#> skeletal muscle actin </#> , as determined by falling ball viscometry, was smaller (mean value 0.5 x 10(-6) M, as compared to 1.9 x 10(-6) M for bovine profilin).	False
TRADD	FADD	These results suggest that TNF-alpha can cause apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells through TNFR1-linked apoptotic factors,  <*> TRADD </*> ,  <#> FADD </#> , and FLICE, and TNF-induced ceramide production may be involved in the pathways.	False

False
alpha-catenin	beta-catenin	Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins with HECD-1 revealed three bands corresponding to E-cadherin,  <*> alpha-catenin </*> , and gamma-catenin and a 79-kDa band which was apparently smaller than that of normal beta-catenin, indicating truncated  <#> beta-catenin </#> .	False
RAD24	MEC3	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17,  <*> RAD24 </*> , and  <#> MEC3 </#> , indicating that the srs2 rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.	False
H4	H2A	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and  <*> H4 </*> , are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones  <#> H2A </#>  and H2B show less heterogeneity.

RVS161	actin	Mutations in  <*> RVS161 </*>  and RVS167, the two yeast amphiphysin homologs, cause very similar growth phenotypes, a depolarized  <#> actin </#>  cytoskeleton, and a defect in the internalization step of endocytosis.	True
armadillo	alpha-catenin	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the  <*> armadillo </*>  repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of  <#> alpha-catenin </#> , although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.	False
fimbrin	L-plastin	Unlike  <*> fimbrin </*> ,  <#> L-plastin </#> 's actin-bundling action was strictly calcium-dependent: the bundles were formed at pCa 7, but not at pCa 6.	False
RAD51	RAD54	LOH was found in the  <*> RAD51 </*>  region in 32% of tumours, in the RAD52 region in 16%, in  <#> RAD54 </#>  in 20% and in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 regions in 49% and 44% respectively.	False
CBP	waf1	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that  <*> CBP </*> /p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <#> waf1 </#>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.	False
PRP21	PRP11	In a model system, the interacting proteins recruiting TFIIIC to DNA were  <*> PRP21 </*>  and PRP9 or PRP21 and  <#> PRP11 </#> .	False

False
cofilin	ADF	In most cases, ADF and  <*> cofilin </*>  colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but  <#> ADF </#>  appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.	False

RAD52	RAD52	The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human  <*> RAD52 </*>  protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and  <#> RAD52 </#>  is species-specific.	False

myosin II	myosin heavy chains	Using ITP (a substrate for  <*> myosin II </*>  ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for myosin II heavy-chain kinase [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of  <#> myosin heavy chains </#>  occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that MHCK was localized at the foci.	False
TPM1	CAP1	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin ( <*> TPM1 </*> ), fimbrin (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein ( <#> CAP1 </#>  and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.	False

actin	talin	Hence, we conclude that in its dimeric form, which is used in  <*> actin </*>  and lipid binding,  <#> talin </#>  is a dumbbell-shaped molecule built of two antiparallel subunits.	True
Rho	gelsolin	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of  <*> Rho </*>  activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as  <#> gelsolin </#>  and profilin.	False
RAD54	RAD57	RAD51,  <*> RAD54 </*> , RAD55 and  <#> RAD57 </#>  are still required when the same transcribed donor is on the chromosome.	False
actin	IGF-I	To determine the effect of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on cardiac contractile protein synthesis in vivo, we measured L-[ring-2, 6-3H]phenylalanine incorporation into myosin heavy chain and  <*> actin </*>  during intravenous infusions (4 h) of either saline or  <#> IGF-I </#>  (1 microgram. kg-1. min-1) in awake rats.

WAF1	proliferating cell nuclear antigen	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21( <*> WAF1 </*> /CIP1) and rescued by the addition of  <#> proliferating cell nuclear antigen </#> , arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol) delta in the conversion reaction.	False
p27	cyclin D3	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <*> p27 </*> , enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to  <#> cyclin D3 </#> /CDK4).

actin	profilins	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to  <*> actin </*>  in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native  <#> profilins </#> ; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

False
H4	acetylase(s)	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone  <*> H4 </*>  versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous  <#> acetylase(s) </#> .	False
actin	actin	It is also possible that PtdIns-4,5-P2 has other roles, such as promoting the release of G  <*> actin </*>  from profilin or promoting the cross-linking of  <#> actin </#>  or its anchorage to the plasma membrane.	False

False
myosin heavy chains	actin	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all  <*> myosin heavy chains </*> , and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated  <#> actin </#> -dependent MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin II requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.

False
UL9	UL42	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins, UL5, UL8,  <*> UL9 </*> ,  <#> UL42 </#> , UL52, SSB, and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.

False
beta-catenin	alpha-catenin	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the amino terminus of alpha-catenin 57-264 behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since  <*> beta-catenin </*>  binding disrupts the  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  dimer.	True

actin	actin	Although profilin released  <*> actin </*>  at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <#> actin </#>  released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.

WASp	verprolin	 <*> WASp </*>  contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC42Hs as well as  <#> verprolin </#> /cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by CDC42Hs-WASp has been identified.	True
TNFR1	RIP	Transcriptional expression of  <*> TNFR1 </*> (p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and  <#> RIP </#>  was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

profilin	profilin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other:  <*> profilin </*>  has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with  <#> profilin </#>  cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.	False
MSH3	methyltransferase	We used yeast as a model to test this hypothesis and found that chromosome deletion of any known nuclear mitotic mismatch repair genes, including MLH1, MSH2,  <*> MSH3 </*> , MSH6, and PMS1, did not rescue mgt1delta O6 MeG DNA repair  <#> methyltransferase </#> -deficient cells from killing by MNNG.	False
myogenin	MRF4	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous  <*> myogenin </*>  and myosin light chain 2 gene but not the endogenous MyoD1,  <#> MRF4 </#> , Myf5, the skeletal muscle actin, or the myosin heavy chain genes.

alpha-catenin	alpha-catenin	A chimera consisting of the  <*> alpha-catenin </*> -binding region of beta-catenin linked to the amino terminus of alpha-catenin 57-264 behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since beta-catenin binding disrupts the  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  dimer.	False
IL-2	IL-2	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <*> IL-2 </*>  production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <#> IL-2 </#>  production.

False
profilin	actin	Moreover, the virus-encoded  <*> profilin </*>  homolog was not required for  <#> actin </#> -associated events, including intracellular virus movement to the periphery of the cell, formation of specialized microvilli, or release of mature virions, as shown by electron microscopy and yields of infectious intra- and extracellular virus.

Brca1	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can stimulate the  <*> Brca1 </*>  promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16(INK4a)  <#> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </#> .	False
Aip1p	cofilin	Here, we report that  <*> Aip1p </*>  also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor  <#> cofilin </#> .	True
actin	acumentin	Effects of macrophage profilin on  <*> actin </*>  in the presence and absence of  <#> acumentin </#>  and gelsolin.	False
cyclin D3	CDK4	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to  <*> cyclin D3 </*> / <#> CDK4 </#> ).	True
NP	M	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein ( <*> NP </*> ) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein (M) gene sequences; another,  <#> M </#>  and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.	False
platelet actin	profilin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of  <*> platelet actin </*>  much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with  <#> profilin </#>  cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.	False
profilins	actin	Our data indicate that even  <*> profilins </*>  of highly distant evolutionary origin can functionally substitute for each other and support the hypothesis that in animal cells, profilins are engaged in regulating either the stability or the kinetic properties of  <#> actin </#>  filaments.	False
H2A	H3	The core histones from Physarum, histones  <*> H2A </*> , H2B,  <#> H3 </#> , and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

srs2	rdh54	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2 rad54 and  <*> srs2 </*>   <#> rdh54 </#>  mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.

False
muscarinic receptor	IL-2	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in  <*> muscarinic receptor </*> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <#> IL-2 </#>  production.

False
alpha-spectrin	actin	Lack of detection in these preparations of a constituent that binds RBC  <*> alpha-spectrin </*>  antibody plus the presence of significant quantities of  <#> actin </#> , further suggests that the principal membrane skeletal element is actin with perhaps smaller quantities of a 240-kd component, identified by others as the protein talin.

True
muscarinic receptors	muscarinic receptor	The findings suggest that M1  <*> muscarinic receptors </*>  are involved in  <#> muscarinic receptor </#> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.	False

profilins	profilin-I	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed  <*> profilins </*>  form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native  <#> profilin-I </#> ; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.	False
T beta 4	actin	As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 ( <*> T beta 4 </*> ), low amounts of profilin promote extensive  <#> actin </#>  assembly off of the pool of actin-T beta 4 complex.	False

True
KIP1	cyclin E-associated kinase	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27( <*> KIP1 </*> ) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in  <#> cyclin E-associated kinase </#>  activity.

False
AP-1	protein kinase C	Together these results indicate that TGFbeta regulates clusterin gene expression through an AP-1 site and its cognate transcription factor  <*> AP-1 </*> , and requires the involvement of  <#> protein kinase C </#> .	False

Ras	p27	However, although expression of  <*> Ras </*>  alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the  <#> p27 </#>  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).	False
UL5	origin-binding protein	On the basis of these results, we present a model for prereplicative site formation in infected cells in which the helicase-primase components ( <*> UL5 </*> , UL8, and UL52), the  <#> origin-binding protein </#>  (UL9), and the viral single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8) assemble together to initiate the process.	True
H4	H1	While poly(ADP-ribose) effectively competed with DNA for binding of histone  <*> H4 </*> , it equally competed with DNA for binding of histone H3 and only inefficiently competed with DNA for binding of histone  <#> H1 </#> .	False

FLICE	FAF	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of  <*> FLICE </*> , Fas, FADD, DR3,  <#> FAF </#> , TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.	False
RAD9	RAD24	In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest requires the checkpoint control genes  <*> RAD9 </*> , RAD17,  <#> RAD24 </#> , MEC1, MEC2 and MEC3.	False

profilin	actin	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from  <*> profilin </*>  too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized  <#> actin </#>  associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.

desmin	SM2	In this study, the expressions of smooth muscle-specific proteins ( <*> desmin </*> , alpha-smooth muscle actin, basic calponin and the smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain isoforms of SM1 and  <#> SM2 </#> ) in three parent and four cloned neuroblastoma cell lines, composed of S-type cells, were examined by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).	False
Thymosin-beta4	Actin	When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for  <*> Thymosin-beta4 </*> . <#> Actin </#> ).	True
alpha 1-syntrophin	87K	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and  <*> alpha 1-syntrophin </*>  interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo  <#> 87K </#>  protein.

beta-catenin	plakoglobin	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with  <*> beta-catenin </*> , whereas the binding of gamma-catenin ( <#> plakoglobin </#> ) to E-cadherin is less efficient.	False
plakoglobin	alpha-catenin	Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and  <*> plakoglobin </*>  bind to the same region of  <#> alpha-catenin </#> , beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa.	True

myosin II heavy-chain kinase	MHCK	Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for  <*> myosin II heavy-chain kinase </*>  [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that  <#> MHCK </#>  was localized at the foci.	False
HECD-1	alpha-catenin	Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins with  <*> HECD-1 </*>  revealed three bands corresponding to E-cadherin,  <#> alpha-catenin </#> , and gamma-catenin and a 79-kDa band which was apparently smaller than that of normal beta-catenin, indicating truncated beta-catenin.

actin	profilin	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified  <*> actin </*>  explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of  <#> profilin </#>  and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.	False

gelsolin	profilin	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as  <*> gelsolin </*>  and  <#> profilin </#> .	False
alpha-catenin	beta-catenin	We found normal levels of  <*> alpha-catenin </*>  and  <#> beta-catenin </#>  in BT549 and HS578t cells; however, low levels of plakoglobin were expressed in these cells compared to those found in weakly invasive MCF-7 cells.	False

False
alpha-Sm actin	vinculin	 <*> alpha-Sm actin </*>  inhibition also led to the formation of less prominent focal adhesions as revealed by immunofluorescence staining against  <#> vinculin </#> , talin, and beta1-integrin.	False
gelsolin	tau	This effect is specific to profilin and  <*> gelsolin </*>  because other cytoskeletal proteins such as  <#> tau </#>  or actin do not affect PI 3-kinase activity.	False
myosin heavy chain	Mhc36B	We find that heterozygotes for actin (Act88F) or  <*> myosin heavy chain </*>  (Mhc36B) null alleles have complex myofibrillar defects, whereas  <#> Mhc36B </#> -/+; Act88F-/+ double heterozygotes have nearly normal myofibrils.	False

APC	armadillo	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin,  <*> APC </*> , and Tcf-4, which bind to the  <#> armadillo </#>  repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.	False
profilin	actin	The very much lower affinity of  <*> profilin </*>  for modified  <#> actin </#>  explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.	True
srs2Delta	rad54	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and  <*> srs2Delta </*>  rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2  <#> rad54 </#>  and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.	False

False
histone	histone	Because  <*> histone </*>  H3 shares many structural features with  <#> histone </#>  H4 and is intimately associated with H4 in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether H3 has similar functions.	False
talin	actin	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal actin filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with  <*> talin </*> , another  <#> actin </#>  and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.

False
FAF	TRADD	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3,  <*> FAF </*> ,  <#> TRADD </#> , and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

actin	desmin	Quantitation of the appearance of X22 banding in primary cultures of myotubes indicates that it precedes that of other myofibrillar proteins and that assembly takes place in the following order: X22, titin, myosin heavy chain,  <*> actin </*> , and  <#> desmin </#> .	True
p38	muscarinic receptor	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via  <*> p38 </*>  MAPK, may be involved in the  <#> muscarinic receptor </#> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.	False
tropomyosin	Mdm20p	In contrast, act1-159 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a  <*> tropomyosin </*>  mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in fimbrin,  <#> Mdm20p </#> , and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these actin-binding proteins.

False
M	F0	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein (NP) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein ( <*> M </*> ) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein ( <#> F0 </#> ) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.

histone	H3	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of  <*> histone </*>  H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone  <#> H3 </#> , whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).	False
actomyosin	myosin heavy chain	Inhibition of  <*> actomyosin </*>  subfragment 1 ATPase activity by analog peptides of the actin-binding site around the Cys(SH1) of  <#> myosin heavy chain </#> .	True

False
cyclin D1	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	Moreover, ectopic expression of  <*> cyclin D1 </*>  and Cdk4 can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16(INK4a)  <#> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </#> .	False
thymidylate synthase	TS	We found that the expression of all these genes, including  <*> thymidylate synthase </*>  ( <#> TS </#> ), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), histone H1, histone H2A + 2B, histone H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.

False
profilin	actin	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of  <*> profilin </*>  in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized  <#> actin </#>  associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.

False
profilin-I	actin	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native  <*> profilin-I </*> ; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit  <#> actin </#>  polymerization.

False
pRb	p27	In investigating the mechanism by which  <*> pRb </*>  induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in  <#> p27 </#> (KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.

CDKI	Cdk2	The main inhibitory action of p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( <*> CDKI </*> ), arises from its binding with the cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( <#> Cdk2 </#> ) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.	False
Neuropilin 1	tyrosine kinase	 <*> Neuropilin 1 </*>  (NP-1) is a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165 (VEGF165) and acts as a coreceptor that enhances VEGF165 function through  <#> tyrosine kinase </#>  VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2).	False

cyclin E	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	Expression of c-Myc or cyclin D1 was sufficient to activate  <*> cyclin E </*> -Cdk2 by promoting the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes lacking the  <#> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </#>  p21, as has been described, following estrogen treatment.

True
talin	actin	Although  <*> talin </*>  has been suggested to act as a linkage protein mediating the attachment of GPIIb-IIIa to  <#> actin </#>  filaments, direct binding of GPIIb-IIIa to this cytoskeletal protein has not been demonstrated.	True

profilin	actin	However, some proteins (e.g.,  <*> profilin </*> ) and other agents (e.g., cytochalasin D) that bind to actin are affected by the presence of fluorescent labels, making  <#> actin </#>  intrinsic fluorescence potentially useful in investigating the interaction of these agents with actin, and in validating data obtained using labeled actin.	False
PDGF-AB	ERK1	In vitro studies indicated that suramin completely blocked PDGF receptor activation or phosphorylation stimulated by  <*> PDGF-AB </*> , inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) kinases (MEK1/2) and  <#> ERK1 </#> /2, and abrogated transcription factor AP-1 DNA-binding activity.
