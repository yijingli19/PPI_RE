False
ROM2	glc7-10	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <*> ROM2 </*> , RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed  <#> glc7-10 </#>  effectively.	True
p120	proteasome	beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin,  <*> p120 </*> (cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when  <#> proteasome </#> -mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.	False
actin	GFP	Unexpectedly, treatment with the  <*> actin </*> -depolymerizing drug latrunculin-A disrupted the medial region targeting pattern, and cells deficient in the actin-binding proteins tropomyosin and profilin also did not exhibit medial  <#> GFP </#> -Cdc42p staining.	False

muscle actin	HHF35	To determine the phenotypes of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in such lesions, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues from two patients with PPH, using two anti <*> muscle actin </*>  antibodies,  <#> HHF35 </#>  and CGA7, and two anti-SMC myosin heavy chain markers, anti-SM1 and anti-SM2 antibodies and related antibodies.	True
beta-catenin	plakoglobin	METHODS: Ileal and colonic biopsy specimens from 19 SpA patients with subclinical inflammatory gut lesions and from seven controls were stained with monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin,  <*> beta-catenin </*>  and  <#> plakoglobin </#>  and a polyclonal antibody against alpha-catenin.	False
histones	H2A	The core  <*> histones </*>  from Physarum, histones  <#> H2A </#> , H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

E-cadherin	alpha-catenin	METHODS: Ileal and colonic biopsy specimens from 19 SpA patients with subclinical inflammatory gut lesions and from seven controls were stained with monoclonal antibodies against  <*> E-cadherin </*> , beta-catenin and plakoglobin and a polyclonal antibody against  <#> alpha-catenin </#> .	False
UL5	UL8	The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV)  <*> UL5 </*> ,  <#> UL8 </#> , and UL52 proteins form a helicase-primase complex in infected cells.	True
beta-catenin	pan-desmocollin	In the basal layer, patches of brightly labeled cells were detected with antibodies to E-cadherin,  <*> beta-catenin </*> , and gamma-catenin, but not with antibodies to P-cadherin, alpha-catenin, or with  <#> pan-desmocollin </#>  and pan-desmoglein antibodies.	False
profilin	actin	The actin monomer-binding protein,  <*> profilin </*> , influences the dynamics of  <#> actin </#>  filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on actin, and promoting barbed-end assembly.	True
rad54Delta	rad54	Lethality of the srs2Delta  <*> rad54Delta </*>  and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2  <#> rad54 </#>  and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.

True
actin	profilin	Inhibition of  <*> actin </*>  polymerization in KCl was stronger than that of the parental  <#> profilin </#> , and the Kd value of its interaction with rabbit skeletal muscle actin, as determined by falling ball viscometry, was smaller (mean value 0.5 x 10(-6) M, as compared to 1.9 x 10(-6) M for bovine profilin).	True
insulin	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	The potentiating effect of  <*> insulin </*>  appears to involve increases in the expression of cyclin E and decreases in the expression of the  <#> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </#>  p27(Kip1).	False
cofilin	actin	However, these rod structures were not observed in response to TSH, forskolin, or TPA, suggesting that dephosphorylation of  <*> cofilin </*>  correlates with the reorganization of  <#> actin </#>  microfilaments but not with the nuclear transport of cofilin.	True
Munc18-2	syntaxin 3	The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the  <*> Munc18-2 </*>  variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from  <#> syntaxin 3 </#>  complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells.	True
p27	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor	The main inhibitory action of  <*> p27 </*> , a  <#> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </#>  (CDKI), arises from its binding with the cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.	True

histone	H3	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of  <*> histone </*>   <#> H3 </#> : with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).	True
vinculin	talin	The undifferentiated cells (a) were unable to spread on gelatin or laminin and grew as rounded colonies, although they were able to spread on fibronectin (b) showed reduced adhesion to laminin, but not fibronectin (c) expressed much reduced levels of beta1 integrin, although levels of alpha5 and alphaV were wild-type (d) were less polarized with increased membrane protrusions compared with a vinculin (-/-) ES cell mutant (e) were unable to assemble  <*> vinculin </*>  or paxillin-containing focal adhesions or actin stress fibers on fibronectin, whereas vinculin (-/-) ES cells were able to assemble  <#> talin </#> -containing focal adhesions.

HHR23B	p58	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include ERCC1, ERCC2 (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the  <*> HHR23B </*> / <#> p58 </#>  and HHR23A subunits of XPC.	True
PRT1	eIF3	By two-hybrid screening we have identified two partners that directly associate with TIF34:  <*> PRT1 </*> , a previously characterized  <#> eIF3 </#>  subunit, and a novel protein of 33 kDa (eIF3-p33) which is part of the eIF3 complex and has an RNA binding domain.	True
histones	H4	Archaeal  <*> histones </*>  are most similar to the globular histone fold region of eukaryal histone  <#> H4 </#> , and the results reported are consistent with archaeal nucleosomes resembling the structure formed by eukaryal histone (H3+H4)2tetramers.	False
proteins	proteins	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large (L; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid (N; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein (P; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa)  <*> p <#> roteins </*>  </#> .	False
profilin	actin	Yeast  <*> profilin </*>  can sequester yeast actin monomers and thereby reduce the ability of yeast  <#> actin </#>  to polymerize, whereas it has little effect on the degree of polymerization of rabbit skeletal muscle actin.	True
DR3	RIP	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD,  <*> DR3 </*> , FAF, TRADD, and  <#> RIP </#>  was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.	False
MEC1	RAD9	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11,  <*> MEC1 </*> , DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in  <#> RAD9 </#> , RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.	False
profilin	actin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments;  <*> profilin </*>  inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <#> actin </#>  with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.	False
M	proteins	Panels of six to 31 MAbs against the haemagglutinin (H), fusion (F), nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix ( <*> M </*> ) proteins of MV and the H, F, NP and P  <#> proteins </#>  of CDV were employed.	False

smooth muscle myosin heavy chain	nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-B	Immunohistochemical studies showed a strong reactivity of most LAM cells for alpha-smooth muscle actin and  <*> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </*>  and a weak to moderate reactivity of a lesser number of cells for desmin and  <#> nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-B </#> .	False
nucleocapsid protein	HN	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains  <*> nucleocapsid protein </*>  (NP) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein (M) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein ( <#> HN </#> ) gene sequences.	False
Act88F	Mhc36B	We find that heterozygotes for actin ( <*> Act88F </*> ) or myosin heavy chain (Mhc36B) null alleles have complex myofibrillar defects, whereas  <#> Mhc36B </#> -/+; Act88F-/+ double heterozygotes have nearly normal myofibrils.	False
CDK2	cyclin E	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/ <*> CDK2 </*>  complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to  <#> cyclin E </#> /CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).	False
glycoprotein 130	collagenase	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether other  <*> glycoprotein 130 </*>  (gp130) binding cytokines can mimic the effects of oncostatin M (OSM) in acting synergistically with interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) to induce cartilage collagen breakdown and  <#> collagenase </#>  expression, and to determine which receptors mediate these effects.	False

False
talin	vimentin	PDGF treatment had no effect on  <*> talin </*> ,  <#> vimentin </#> , or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.	False
verprolin	actin	However, disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A does not alter verprolin's location, indicating that  <*> verprolin </*>  establishes and maintains its location independent of the  <#> actin </#>  cytoskeleton.	True
F	proteins	The analysis of the viral proteins by electrophoresis indicates molecular weight differences between CDV and PDV in the fusion ( <*> F </*> ), phosphoprotein (P), H, nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M)  <#> proteins </#> .	False
myosin	actin-binding protein	Gravin is not likely to be a nonerythroid spectrin, talin,  <*> myosin </*> , or  <#> actin-binding protein </#>  based on the lack of reactivity of antigravin with these polypeptides in immunoblots.	False

histones	histones	The core  <*> histones </*>  from Physarum,  <#> histones </#>  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.	False
E-cadherin	alpha-catenin	In cancerous tissues, the frequency of reduced expression of beta-catenin (28 of 86, 33%) was similar to that of  <*> E-cadherin </*>  (19 of 86, 22%), but less than that of  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  (47 of 86, 55%).	False
alpha-catenin 57-264	alpha-catenin	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the amino terminus of  <*> alpha-catenin 57-264 </*>  behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since beta-catenin binding disrupts the  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  dimer.	False
Vascular endothelial cadherin	beta-catenin	 <*> Vascular endothelial cadherin </*>  (VE-cadherin) clusters were co-localized with  <#> beta-catenin </#> , an important signal transduction ligand, and with alpha-catenin, which is thought to link the complex to the peri-junctional actin.	True

PKC1	WSC1	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked  <*> PKC1 </*>  as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/ <#> WSC1 </#> /SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.	False
E-cadherin	DE-cadherin	Three components of Drosophila adherens junctions, analogous to those in vertebrates, have been identified: Armadillo (homolog of beta-catenin), Drosophila  <*> E-cadherin </*>  ( <#> DE-cadherin </#> ), and alpha-catenin.	False

H4	waf1	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone  <*> H4 </*> , and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <#> waf1 </#>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.	False
dystrophin	DRP	In this recombinant expression system, the  <*> dystrophin </*>  relatives, human dystrophin related protein ( <#> DRP </#>  or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin.	True

False
profilin	actin	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other:  <*> profilin </*>  has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <#> actin </#>  with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

False
actin	CAP1	A null mutation of the  <*> actin </*>  gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1), fimbrin (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein ( <#> CAP1 </#>  and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.	False
Rho	actin	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the  <*> Rho </*>  signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to  <#> actin </#> -related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.

actin	profilin	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled  <*> actin </*>  in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by  <#> profilin </#>  of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.

False
p27	CDKI	The main inhibitory action of  <*> p27 </*> , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( <#> CDKI </#> ), arises from its binding with the cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.	True

False
plakoglobin	alpha-catenin	beta-catenin or  <*> plakoglobin </*>  is associated directly with the cadherin;  <#> alpha-catenin </#>  binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.	False

APC	Tcf-4	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin,  <*> APC </*> , and  <#> Tcf-4 </#> , which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.	False

H4	H3	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone  <*> H4 </*>  versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone  <#> H3 </#> , whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).	False
profilin	profilin	By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled  <*> profilin </*>  binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of  <#> profilin </#>  for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers.	False

DNase I	actin	The centrifugation assay and the  <*> DNase I </*>  inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to  <#> actin </#>  filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.	False
profilin-I	actin	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba  <*> profilin-I </*>  has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit  <#> actin </#>  polymerization.

False
armadillo	beta-catenin	Since alpha-catenin is required for cadherin-mediated adhesion, the  <*> armadillo </*>  repeat region alone probably cannot promote cell adhesion, making it unlikely that  <#> beta-catenin </#>  induces axis duplication by increasing cell adhesion.	False
alpha-catenin	trypsin	For example, it is associated with  <*> alpha-catenin </*>  and beta-catenin (Armadillo), and protected from  <#> trypsin </#>  digestion only in the presence of Ca2+, as is the case for many of classic cadherins.	False

False
TSH	actin	However, these rod structures were not observed in response to  <*> TSH </*> , forskolin, or TPA, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cofilin correlates with the reorganization of  <#> actin </#>  microfilaments but not with the nuclear transport of cofilin.	False

False
E-cad	beta-catenin	We found that the down-regulation of  <*> E-cad </*> , alpha-catenin, and  <#> beta-catenin </#>  expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.	False
syntaxin 3	syntaxin 3	The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with  <*> syntaxin 3 </*>  correlated well with their ability to displace SNAP-23 from  <#> syntaxin 3 </#>  complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells.	True

False
IL-2	AP-1	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <*> IL-2 </*>  production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor  <#> AP-1 </#>  and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.	False
actin	profilin	Although profilin released  <*> actin </*>  at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from  <#> profilin </#>  too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.	False
Aprotinin	thrombin	 <*> Aprotinin </*>  inhibited platelet aggregation induced by thrombin (0.25 U.ml-1) with IC50 200 kIU.ml-1, and inhibited the rise of cytosolic free calcium concentration in platelets stimulated by  <#> thrombin </#>  (0.1 U.ml-1) in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+ 0.5 mmol.L-1 (IC50 117 and 50 kIU.ml-1, respectively), but had no effect on the amounts of actin and myosin heavy chain associated with cytoskeletons.

MSH2	MSH3	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires  <*> MSH2 </*>  and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and  <#> MSH3 </#> .	False

cyclin E	CDK4	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to  <*> cyclin E </*> /CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/ <#> CDK4 </#> ).

True
H3	histones	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B,  <*> H3 </*> , and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3;  <#> histones </#>  H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

Armadillo	CREB	 <*> Armadillo </*>  (Arm) repeat 10 to the COOH terminus of beta-catenin is involved in binding to CBP, whereas beta-catenin interacts directly with the  <#> CREB </#> -binding domain of CBP.	False
ATPase	MHCK	Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II  <*> ATPase </*> ) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for myosin II heavy-chain kinase [ <#> MHCK </#> ]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that MHCK was localized at the foci.	False
Tcf-4	beta-catenin	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and  <*> Tcf-4 </*> , which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of  <#> beta-catenin </#>  in the nucleus.	False
msh2	MSH2	In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of  <*> msh2 </*> , msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the  <#> MSH2 </#>  protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins.

False
PDS1	RAD17	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1,  <*> PDS1 </*> , and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9,  <#> RAD17 </#> , RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.	False

True
PDGF	vimentin	 <*> PDGF </*>  treatment had no effect on talin,  <#> vimentin </#> , or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.	False
E-cadherin	gamma-catenin	The cytoplasmic domain of  <*> E-cadherin </*>  cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with beta-catenin, whereas the binding of  <#> gamma-catenin </#>  (plakoglobin) to E-cadherin is less efficient.	False

True
CDK	p27	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1  <*> CDK </*>  activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the  <#> p27 </#>  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).

pRb	KIP1	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that  <*> pRb </*>  causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27( <#> KIP1 </#> ) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.	True
E-cadherin	E-cadherin	The cytoplasmic domain of  <*> E-cadherin </*>  cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with beta-catenin, whereas the binding of gamma-catenin (plakoglobin) to  <#> E-cadherin </#>  is less efficient.	False
histones	histone	The core histones from Physarum,  <*> histones </*>  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian  <#> histone </#>  H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

False
H4	acetylase(s)	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone  <*> H4 </*>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous  <#> acetylase(s) </#> .	True
SMC myosin heavy chain	SM2	To determine the phenotypes of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in such lesions, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues from two patients with PPH, using two antimuscle actin antibodies, HHF35 and CGA7, and two anti- <*> SMC myosin heavy chain </*>  markers, anti-SM1 and anti- <#> SM2 </#>  antibodies and related antibodies.

actin	actin	In this study, we demonstrate that profilin isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on  <*> actin </*>  in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of  <#> actin </#>  cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells.	False

True
MAPK	muscarinic receptor	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38  <*> MAPK </*> , may be involved in the  <#> muscarinic receptor </#> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.	False
SIR4	MET15	Deletion of  <*> SIR4 </*>  enhanced mURA3 and  <#> MET15 </#>  silencing, but deletion of SIR1 or SIR3 did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci.	True
p58	XPC	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include ERCC1, ERCC2 (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the HHR23B/ <*> p58 </*>  and HHR23A subunits of  <#> XPC </#> .	True
H2A.1	H3	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone  <*> H2A.1 </*> , histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone H2A.X, histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone  <#> H3 </#>  variants and histone H4.

TNFR1	FADD	These results suggest that TNF-alpha can cause apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells through  <*> TNFR1 </*> -linked apoptotic factors, TRADD,  <#> FADD </#> , and FLICE, and TNF-induced ceramide production may be involved in the pathways.	True
profilin II	actin	In extracts from mouse brain, profilin I and  <*> profilin II </*>  can form complexes with regulators of endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and  <#> actin </#>  assembly.	False

True
CBP	CREB	MLL is fused in-frame to a different exon of  <*> CBP </*>  in two patients producing chimeric proteins containing the AT-hooks, methyltransferase homology domain, and transcriptional repression domain of MLL fused to the  <#> CREB </#>  binding domain or to the bromodomain of CBP.	False
